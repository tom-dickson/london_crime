# Exploratory analysis of London crime data + logistic regression

The aim of this project is twofold. First, I want to gain insight into trends in London crime data between October 2021 and March 2022 through exploratory data analysis and visualization. Second, I implement logistic regression to see if a crrime's outcome can be reliably predicted based on where it occurs and the type of crime committed. Doing so will provide statistics which could be used to change policing practice and encourage measurably better policing.

Data collection and initial analysis can be found in theee datacoll.py file. Code for analysis specific to crime outcomes is in solver.py, and the logistic regression implementation is in london_logreg.py. Graphs and charts generated by these files make up the rest of the project

Data for this project was pulled from data.police.uk
